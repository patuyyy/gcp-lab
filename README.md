# GCP – Cloud & DevOps Lab

This repository serves as a personal cloud and DevOps lab on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**. It is used to experiment with real-world cloud architecture, networking, and DevOps workflows using managed cloud infrastructure.

The lab focuses on hands-on learning rather than application features, emphasizing infrastructure design, automation, security boundaries, and operational reliability in cloud-native environments.

---

## 🎯 Lab Objectives

- Explore cloud-native infrastructure on GCP
- Practice Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Design secure networking with private workloads
- Understand managed compute, load balancing, and scalability
- Apply DevOps principles such as automation, immutability, and CI/CD

---

## 🧪 Lab Projects

Each folder in this repository represents an independent lab or project:

- **`decommoir/`**  
  A full cloud-native system deployed on GCP, featuring private compute, managed load balancing, CI/CD automation, and Infrastructure as Code.

More labs and experiments may be added over time.

## 📌 Notes

This repository is intended for learning, experimentation, and portfolio purposes. All infrastructure is designed to reflect real-world cloud and DevOps practices rather than minimal demo setups.
